1. Diabetes Prediction System
This project is a web-based application that predicts whether a person has diabetes or not based on certain health parameters. The system uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and has a simple yet elegant user interface designed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The backend is powered by Flask, a Python web framework.

2. Features
Machine Learning Model: Trained using SVM to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
User-friendly Interface: Built using Bootstrap, CSS animations, and diabetes-related images.
Real-time Predictions: Users can input their health data and receive an instant prediction.
Precautions and Food Recommendations: Based on the prediction, users are provided with helpful tips and diet suggestions.
Responsive Design: The web app is responsive and works across various devices.
          
3. Usage
3.1. Open the application by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
3.2. Fill in the form with the following parameters:
Number of Pregnancies
Glucose Level
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin Level
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF)
Age
3.3. Click "Predict" to get the result.
3.4. Based on the prediction, the app will show whether the person is diabetic or not, and provide health-related tips and food recommendations.

4. Technologies
4.1 Backend:
1. Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for building the API.
2. scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for training the SVM model.
3. pandas: Data handling and manipulation.
4. numpy: Numerical computing.
   
4.2 Frontend:
1. HTML5/CSS3: Basic structure and styling.
2. Bootstrap: For responsive design and layout.
3. JavaScript: To handle form submission and communication with the Flask API.
4. CSS Animations: Adds a dynamic touch to the frontend.
