Diabetes Prediction System
   
This project is a web-based application that predicts whether a person has diabetes or not based on certain health parameters. The system uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and has a simple yet elegant user interface designed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The backend is powered by Flask, a Python web framework.

Features

Machine Learning Model: Trained using SVM to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
User-friendly Interface: Built using Bootstrap, CSS animations, and diabetes-related images.
Real-time Predictions: Users can input their health data and receive an instant prediction.
Precautions and Food Recommendations: Based on the prediction, users are provided with helpful tips and diet suggestions.
Responsive Design: The web app is responsive and works across various devices.

Technologies

Backend:

Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for building the API.

scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for training the SVM model.

pandas: Data handling and manipulation.

numpy: Numerical computing.
   
Frontend:

HTML5/CSS3: Basic structure and styling.

Bootstrap: For responsive design and layout.

JavaScript: To handle form submission and communication with the Flask API.

CSS Animations: Adds a dynamic touch to the frontend.
